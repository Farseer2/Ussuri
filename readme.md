# Ludum Dare 25 Framework (Codename Ussuri)
### Written for Lua 5.1 and LÃ–VE 0.8.0

The purpose for this library arose after *Ludum Dare 24* where I (Lucien Greathouse) had nothing to begin with for code. I wrote everything from scratch, and with it being my first Ludum Dare, time was kind of sort of a real issue.

Chances are it will be poorly documented until I decide otherwise, for it's intended primarily for personal use for, you guessed it, Ludum Dare 25!
