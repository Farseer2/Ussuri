# Ussuri Framework for Lua and LÃ–VE

The purpose for this framework arose after *Ludum Dare 24* where I (Lucien Greathouse) had nothing to begin with for code. I wrote everything from scratch, and with it being my first Ludum Dare, time was kind of sort of a real issue.

The engine made its debut in my Ludum Dare 25 compo entry and is being worked on nearly constantly.
