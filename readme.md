# Ussuri Framework for Lua and LÖVE

Ussuri is designed for use with LÖVE 0.8.0 and Lua 5.1 and is tested regularly under Windows with both vanilla Lua and LuaJIT. It has been in development since November, 2012 and receives updates at least every week. Presently, I am preparing for a stable 1.0.0 release of the framework.

Ussuri is named after a conglomerate of things such as a river, a bay, and several types of animal. You can use Ussuri for a lot of things to, showing a loose correlation, but I haven't thought that through too terribly much. Above all, Ussuri _sounds_ cool.

**If you are able to assist in testing for multiple platforms, email me at me@lpghatguy.com as I presently am the only one testing the framework.**
